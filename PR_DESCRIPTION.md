```

### Database Structure

Portfolio data is stored in **Firebase Realtime Database** under:
```
portfolios/
  {userId}/
    projects/
      {projectId}: { title, description, techStack, githubLink, liveDemoLink, thumbnailUrl, updatedAt }
    skills/
      {skillId}: { name, category, proficiency, updatedAt }
    experience/
      {experienceId}: { companyName, role, startDate, endDate, isCurrent, description, updatedAt }
```

### Key Technologies

- **Database**: Firebase Realtime Database
- **Image Storage**: Cloudinary (with base64 fallback)
- **Form Validation**: Custom validation with error messages
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React Hooks

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **Tabbed Interface**: Easy navigation between Projects, Skills, and Experience
- **Visual Feedback**: Loading states, success messages, and error handling
- **Inline Editing**: Click edit on any item to modify in the same view
- **Preview Panels**: Right sidebar shows existing items with edit/delete options
- **Form Validation**: Real-time validation with clear error messages
- **Tech Stack Suggestions**: Quick-add buttons for popular technologies

## 🔒 Security & Validation

- **Authentication Required**: Only logged-in users can access/ modify portfolio
- **User Isolation**: Users can only access their own portfolio data
- **URL Validation**: GitHub and demo links are validated
- **Date Validation**: Start date must be before end date
- **Input Sanitization**: All inputs are validated before submission

## 📝 Database Rules Required

Add these rules to your Firebase Realtime Database:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "portfolios": {
      "$userId": {
        ".read": "auth != null && auth.uid == $userId",
        ".write": "auth != null && auth.uid == $userId"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## 🔌 Environment Variables

Optional Cloudinary configuration (for image uploads):

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=ml_default
```

If not configured, the app automatically falls back to base64 encoding for images.
